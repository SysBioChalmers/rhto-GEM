# Rhodosporidium_toruloides-GEM

- Brief Model Description

This repository contains the current genome-scale metabolic model of _Rhodosporidium toruloides_, named **iRhto**. Various different updated versions can be downloaded as [releases](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/Rhodosporidium_toruloides-GEM/releases).

- Abstract

_Rhodosporidium toruloides_ is an oleaginous yeast. It is a red basidiomycete isolated from wood pulp from conifers. _R. toruloides_ has been linked to bovine mastitis, but its epidemiology has not yet been reported. The anamorph associated with the species is _Mycotorula rubescens_ (Saito) Cif. & Redaelli. It is a good producer for carotenoids and some important enzymes. The yeast is capable of synthesizing fatty acids and could potentially be a source for engineering lipid-production pathways.

## Installation

### Required Software

  * This model is recommended to be used with the [**RAVEN toolbox for MATLAB**](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/RAVEN) (version 2.0).
  * Alternatively, the model can also be directly used with the [COBRA toolbox for MATLAB](https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox).

### Dependencies - Recommended Software
* Please see the [RAVEN toolbox](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/RAVEN) repository for dependencies regarding RAVEN.

### Installation Instructions
* Just want to use the model? Clone it from [master](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/Yarrowia_lipolytica_W29-GEM) in the Github repo, or just download [the latest release](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/Rhodosporidium_toruloides-GEM/releases).
* Wish to also contribute? Fork it to your Github account, and create a new branch from [`devel`](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/Rhodosporidium_toruloides-GEM/tree/devel).
